## Bubble Pop Game

This is my first game using SFML. Use your mouse to destory blue bubbles as they fall from the sky. Avoid yellow bubbles as they do damage to they player when destroyed, and always get the red bubbles because they give extra health. When blue and red bubbles fall below the screen, they do damage to the player.
